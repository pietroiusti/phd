          <h3>What is the nature of morality and value?</h3>

          <p class="fragment">What's the difference between “science” and “ethics”?
            Between “description” and “evaluation”?</p>

          <p class="fragment">This is one the greatest and oldest problems in philosophy</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Why?</h3>

            <p class="fragment">The evaluative domain seems to
              involve an element of subjectivity.
              <p><small class="fragment">Think, in particular, of matters of “taste”.</small></p>
            </p>

            <p class="fragment">Values are often not fully perceived
              as “facts”.</p>

            Or do we approve of them, because they are good?

          <p class="fragment"><small>Questions like this one have been
          asked since the dawn of philosophy.</small></p>

          <h3>Disagreement</h3>

          <p class="fragment">The phenomenon and concept of
            disagreement has had a special place in the
            meta-evaluative investigation.

          <div class="fragment">
            <p>In analytic philosophy, since G.E. Moore (1912), issues
              about disagreement and value have been debated.</p>

          <h3>A problem with disagreement</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Moore argued that subjectivism was at
            odds with common sense. </p>

          <p class="fragment">Subjectivism was an attempt to account
            for the non-objective aspect of morality.</p>

          <p class="fragment">Subjectivism: “x is wrong” ≈ “x has property of being approved by me” </p>

          <!-- <p class="fragment">This debate is still alive.</p> -->

        <!-- Relativists VS
           - Contextualists VS Expressivists, etc... Empirical

          <h3>If subjectivism were right...</h3>
          <ul  class="fragment">
            <li>A: x is wrong</li>
            <li>B: No, x is not wrong</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="fragment">↓</p>

          <ul class="fragment">
            <li>C: x has the property of being disapproved by me</li>
            <li>D: No [?!], x does not have the property of being disapproved by me.</li>
          </ul>


          <p  class="fragment">A and B disagree. <spam  class="fragment">But: C and D do not.</span></p>

          <p  class="fragment">Moore: there must be something wrong with subjectivism.
            Goodness must be a non-natural property.

          <p class="fragment">I have particularly engaged with the thought of Charles
          Stevenson</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Stevenson gave an answer to Moore.</p>

          <p class="fragment">He offered a metaethical picture according to which the
            difference between description and evaluation is to be found
            at the psychological level.</p>

          <p class="fragment">Famously, he distinguished “Disagreement in
          belief” vs “Disagreement in attitude”.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

          <p>My engagement with Stevenson's ideas has led to the developement of
            several projects.</p>

          <p class="fragment"><small>History of metaethical noncognitivism</small></p>

          <p class="fragment"><small>A noncognitivist picture of ethics</small></p>

          <p class="fragment"><small>A minimalist, or deflationary, understanding of <em>truth</em> (and related notions like <em>belief</em> and <em>fact</em>)</small></p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Some of the upshots of those investigations have been

          <h3>The Challenging Element</h3>
          <p class="fragment">One element that keeps the papers
          connected:</p>

          <p><blockquote class="fragment">“a motive for altering or calling into question the attitude of the
            other”.</blockquote></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The papers</h3>

          <p><span class="fragment">The first paper has a quite narrow
          focus:</span> <span style="font-size:0.7em" class="fragment">it
          is concerned with whether moral and taste judgments are
          different with the respect to the presence of disposition to
          challenge conflicting judgments.</span></p>

          <p><span class="fragment">The second paper is a much more
            ambitious project:</span> <span style="font-size:0.7em" class="fragment">there
          I attempt to provide an account of what it is for two people
          to have a disagreement.</span></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>The First Paper</h4>
          <h2 class="fragment">Disagreement and Conflict: How Moral and Taste Judge-
            ments Do <em>Not</em> Differ</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Challenging in Eriksson</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Eriksson thinks that the challenging element can be used
          to distinguish moral judgments and taste judgments.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The intuitive asymmetry</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Eriksson aims to explain the following (alleged) intuitive asymmetry:</p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <strong>Intuitive Asymmetry</strong>: Conflicting moral
            judgments are intuititively taken as mistaken, whereas
            conflicting taste judgments typically are not.
          </p>

          <!-- # - In order to explain this asymmetry, Eriksson puts
               #   forward two claims: -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Explaining the intuitive asymmetry</h3>
          <p class="fragment">In order to explain this asymmetry (I won't go into the details),
          Eriksson puts forward the following claim:</p>

          <!-- <p class="fragment">The intuition that conflicting judgments are mistaken consists in
               being disposed to challenge them.</p>
               <p><small class="fragment">Stevenson is the explicit source of this
               challenging element</small></p> -->

          <p class="fragment">Moral judgments are necessarily attended
          by a disposition to challenge conflicting judgments, whereas
          taste judgments are not.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Eriksson's arguments</h3>
          <p class="fragment">His arguments are of two types:</p>

          <p class="fragment">First, arguments in support of the
            thesis that taste judgments are only <em>contingently</em> connected
            with a challenging disposition.</p>

          <p class="fragment">Second, arguments to the effect that moral judgments are
            necessarily attended by a challenging disposition.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>My Contribution</h3>

          <p class="fragment">The contribution of the paper consists
          in showing that none of Eriksson's arguments discloses a
          substantial difference with respect to the presence of a
          disposition to challenge conflicting judgments.</p>
          <!--
               <p class="fragment">If it is to be shown that moral judgments and taste
               judgments differ with regard to the presence of a
               disposition to challenge conflicting judgements, then
               arguments other than Eriksson’s are needed.</p>
          -->

          <p class="fragment">The question of whether moral judgments
          and taste judgments are different with respect to the
          presence of a challenging disposition remains open.</p>

          <h4>The Second Paper</h4>
          <h2 class="fragment">Having a disagreement: expression, persuasion and demand</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p class="fragment">In contrast with the narrowly focused character of the first
            paper, in the second paper I embark in a much more ambitious
            project.</p>

          <p class="fragment">My aim is to put forward a new account of what it is to have
            a disagreement.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>State VS Activity</h4>

          <p class="fragment">It is common to distinguish two ordinary senses of
          ‘disagreement’:</p>

          <ul style="font-size:0.7em">
            <li class="fragment">On the one hand, disagreement can be a kind of <em>state</em> people are
              in (<em>being in disagreement</em>). Disagreement in the state sense
              <strong>requires no interaction</strong>.</li>

            <br>

            <li class="fragment">On the other hand, disagreement can be a type of
              linguistic <em>activity</em> speakers engage in (<em>having a
              disagreement</em>). Disagreement as an activity <strong>is a type of
              interaction</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Having a disagreement?</h3>

          <br>

          <p>
            <blockquote style="font-style:normal" class="fragment">“Whether [two persons] are <em>having a disagreement</em> [. . . ] depends only
              on their attitudes and actions towards each other.”
              (MacFarlane 2014)</blockquote>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Having a disagreement?</h3>
          <p class="fragment">But what are the “attitudes and actions” that constitute
            the activity of having a disagreement?</p>

          <p class="fragment">What kind of interaction is the activity of having a
          disagreement?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Expression and Persuasion</h3>
          <p class="fragment">I present and rejects two views:</p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>: A and B are having a disagreement iff they are
            expressing conflicting attitudes (See Plunkett&Sundell 2013,
            2021; Zeman 2020)
          </p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <strong>PERSUASION</strong>: A and B are having a
            disagreement iff they are expressing conflicting attitudes
            <strong>and at least one of them is attempting to change the
            attitude of the other</strong>.(Sinclair 2021)
          </p>
          <p class="fragment"><small> Presented as a Stevensonian
            view. Inspired by Stevenson's challenging element.</small></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>My criticism</h3>
          <p class="fragment">EXPRESSION is too little. PERSUASION is too much.</p>

          <p class="fragment">EXPRESSION is not sufficient.</p>

          <p class="fragment">PERSUASION is not necessary.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>

          <p class="fragment">A view that goes beyond EXPRESSION but that does not go as far as PERSUASION goes</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Demand</h3>
          <p class="fragment">DEMAND: A and B are having a disagreement iff they are expressing
          conflicting attitudes <strong>and at least one of them is demanding that her
          attitude be shared by the other</strong>.</p>

          <br>

          <p style="font-size:0.8em" class="fragment">In my usage, demanding consists in advancing the normative claim
          that the other should, or is required, to agree.</p>

          <br>

          <p style="font-size:0.8em" class="fragment">DEMAND is a Stevensonian view as well (a development a of the
          “calling into question element”).</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Disagreement in the state sense</h3>
          <p class="fragment">A question which I have only indirectly addressed: What is
          disagreement in the state sense?</p>

          <p class="fragment">It's unclear what the relation between the state and the activity
          is.</p>
          <p class="fragment">
            <small>There is no convergence in the literature.</small>
          </p>

          <p class="fragment">In particular: is there such a thing as
          a non-doxastic disagreement (disagreement without
          conflicting beliefs)?</p>

          <p class="fragment">Many have answered this question
          affirmatively, in different ways.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Experimental Philosophy</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Experimental research on disagreement and values has been growing</p>

          <small><ul>
            <li class="fragment">Folk moral objectivism (Sarkissian et al. 2011)</li>

            <li class="fragment">Moral semantics (Khoo & Knobe 2016)</li>

            <li class="fragment">The nature of aesthetic judgments (Cova et al. 2019)</li>
          </ul></small>

          <p class="fragment">However the issue of non-doxastic disagreement has not
            been directly addressed. <small>(One exception: Shemmer &  Bex-Priestley 2021)</small></p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>My Experimental investigation</h3>

          <p>I have conducted some experiments to shed light on
          whether there is such a thing as non-doxastic disagreement.</p>

        <section>
          <p>The study, which was pre-registrered on AsPredicted and asks
          whether people are inclined to ascribe disagreement in cases
          of conflicting beliefs (e.g. A believes that the cake is
          tasty and B doesn't) to a greater extent than they are in
          cases of analogous conflicting non-doxastic mental states
          (e.g. A likes the cake and B doesn't).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>408 people were recruited through Prolific. Participants
            were excluded from the final sample if they failed to
            complete the survey (n = 5) or provided an incorrect
            answer to a comprehension check (n = 56). The final sample
            included 347 participants.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight
          conditions (four doxastic conditions and four non-doxastic)</p>

          <p>In each condition participants received a vignette
          describing two persons who live in different countries,
          don't know each other, and hold two ``conflicting'' mental
            states.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Participants were asked how much they agreed (on a scale
            from 1 to 7) with the statement that the two persons
            described in the vignette disagree.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Data were analyzed using a linear mixed effects model, with
          state-type as a fixed effect and domain-type as a random
          effect (with random intercepts but not random slopes).</p>

          <p>There was a significant effect such that participants agreed
            more with the statement in the doxastic conditions than in
            the non-doxastic conditions, χ2(1) = 54.29, p < .001.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- <section>
             <h3 class="fragment">The result</h3>

             <p class="fragment">People tend to agree in the doxastic case, but give
             wildly different answers in the non-doxastic case (with the
             average ending up in the middle of the scale).</p>
