          <h3>What is the nature of morality and value?</h3>

          <p class="fragment">What's the difference between “science” and “ethics”?
            Between “description” and “evaluation”?</p>
          
          <p class="fragment">This is one the greatest and oldest problems in philosophy</p>
          
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Why?</h3>

            <p class="fragment">The evaluative domain seems to
              involve an element of subjectivity.
              <p><small class="fragment">Think, in particular, of matters of “taste”.</small></p>
            </p>
            
            <p class="fragment">Values are often not fully perceived
              as “facts”.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Metaethics</h3>
          <p>The nature of value is investigated since the beginning of philosophy.</p>

          <h4>“Analytic” philosophy:</h4>

          <p class="fragment">What are ethical <em>properties</em>? (metaphysics)</p>


          <p class="fragment">What is the <em>meaning</em> of ethical terms? (philosophy of language)</p>

          <h3>Disagreement</h3>

          <p class="fragment">The phenomenon and concept of
            disagreement has had a special place in the
            meta-evaluative investigation.

          <h3>A problem with disagreement</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Moore argued that subjectivism was at
            odds with common sense. </p>

          <p class="fragment">Subjectivism was exactly an attempt to account for
            the non-objectivity of morality.</p>

          <p class="fragment">Subjectivism: “x is wrong” ≈ “x has property of being approved by me” </p>
          
          <!-- <p class="fragment">This debate is still alive.</p> -->

          <ul  class="fragment">
            <li>A: x is wrong</li>
            <li>B: No, x is not wrong</li>

            <li>D: No [?!], x does not have the property of being disapproved by me.</li>
          </ul>


          <p  class="fragment">A and B disagree.<spam  class="fragment">C and D do not.</span></p>

          <p  class="fragment">Moore: there must be something wrong with subjectivism.
            Goodness must be a non-natural property.

          </div>
          <p class="fragment">I have particularly engaged with the thought of Charles
          Stevenson</p>

          
        </section>

        <section>
          <p class="fragment">Stevenson gave an answer to Moore.</p>
          
          <p class="fragment">He offered a metaethical picture according to which the
            difference between description and evaluation is to be found
            at the psychological level.</p>

          <p class="fragment">He distinguished “Disagreement in
          belief” vs “Disagreement in attitude”.</p>

        <section>
          
          <p>My engagement with Stevenson's ideas has led to the edevelopement of
            several projects.</p>

          <p>Some upshots of those investigations have been published

          <h3>The Challenging Element</h3>
          <p class="fragment">One element that keeps the papers
          connected:</p>
          
          <p><blockquote class="fragment">“a motive for altering or calling into question the attitude of the
            other”.</blockquote></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The papers</h3>

          <p><span class="fragment">The first paper has a quite narrow
          focus:</span> <span class="fragment">it
          is concerned with whether moral and taste judgments are
          different with the respect to the presence of disposition to
          challenge conflicting judgments.</span></p>

          <p><span class="fragment">The second paper is a much more
          ambitious project:</span> <span class="fragment">there
          I attempt to provide an account of what it is for two people
          to have a disagreement.</span></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>The First Paper</h4>
          <h2 class="fragment">Disagreement and Conflict: How Moral and Taste Judge-
            ments Do <em>Not</em> Differ</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Challenging in Eriksson</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Eriksson thinks that the challenging element can be used
          to distinguish moral judgments and taste judgments.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The intuitive asymmetry</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Eriksson aims to explain the following (alleged) intuitive asymmetry:</p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <strong>Intuitive Asymmetry</strong>: Conflicting moral
            judgments are intuititively taken as mistaken, whereas
            conflicting taste judgments typically are not.
          </p>

          <!-- # - In order to explain this asymmetry, Eriksson puts
               #   forward two claims: -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Explaining the intuitive asymmetry</h3>
          <p class="fragment">In order to explain this asymmetry (I won't go into the details),
          Eriksson puts forward the following claim:</p>

          <!-- <p class="fragment">The intuition that conflicting judgments are mistaken consists in
               being disposed to challenge them.</p>
               <p><small class="fragment">Stevenson is the explicit source of this
               challenging element</small></p> -->

          <p class="fragment">Moral judgments are necessarily attended by a
          disposition to challenge conflicting judgments (= moral
          judgments are in part a disposition to challenge conflicting
          judgments), whereas taste judgments are not.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Eriksson's arguments</h3>
          <p class="fragment">His arguments are of two types:</p>
          
          <p class="fragment">Eriksson offers arguments in support of the thesis that
          taste judgments are only /contingently/ connected with a
          disposition to challenge conflicting judgments.</p>

          <p class="fragment">Eriksson offers arguments in support of the thesis that moral
          judgments are /necessarily/ connected with a disposition to challenge
          conflicting judgments.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Contribution</h3>

          <p class="fragment">The contribution of the paper consists
          in showing that none of Eriksson's arguments discloses a
          substantial difference with respect to the presence of a
          disposition to challenge conflicting judgments.</p>

          <p class="fragment">If it is to be shown that moral judgments and taste
          judgments differ with regard to the presence of a
          disposition to challenge conflicting judgements, then
          arguments other than Eriksson’s are needed.</p>

          <h4>The Second Paper</h4>
          <h2 class="fragment">Having a disagreement: expression, persuasion and demand</h2>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p class="fragment">In contrast with the narrowly focused character of the first
            paper, in the second paper I embark in a much more ambitious
            project.</p>
          
          <p class="fragment">My aim is to put forward a new account of what it is to have
            a disagreement.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>State VS Activity</h4>
          
          <p class="fragment">It is common to distinguish two ordinary senses of
          ‘disagreement’:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">One the one hand, disagreement can be a kind of <em>state</em> people are
              in (<em>being in disagreement</em>). Disagreement in the state sense
              <strong>requires no interaction</strong>.</li>

            <li class="fragment">On the other hand, disagreement can be a type of
              linguistic <em>activity</em> speakers engage in (<em>having a
              disagreement</em>). Disagreement as an activity <strong>is a type of
              interaction</strong>.</li>
          </ul>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Having a disagreement?</h3>

          <p class="fragment">MacFarlane (2014):</p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <blockquote>“Whether [two persons] are <em>having a disagreement</em> [. . . ] depends only
              on their attitudes and actions towards each other.”</blockquote>
          </p>
          

          
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Having a disagreement?</h3>
          <p class="fragment">But what are the “attitudes and actions” that constitute
            the activity of having a disagreement?</p>

          <p class="fragment">What kind of interaction is the activity of having a
          disagreement?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Expression and Persuasion</h3>
          <p class="fragment">I present and rejects two views:</p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <strong>EXPRESSION</strong> A and B are having a disagreement iff they are
            expressing conflicting attitudes (See Plunkett&Sundell 2013,
            2021; Zeman 2020)
          </p>

          <p class="fragment">
            <strong>PERSUASION</strong>: A and B are having a
            disagreement iff they are expressing conflicting attitudes
            and at least one of them is attempting to change the
            attitude of the other.(Sinclair 2021)
          </p>
          <p class="fragment"><small> Presented as a Stevensonian
            view. Inspired by Stevenson's challenging element.</small></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>My criticism</h3>
          <p class="fragment">EXPRESSION is too little. PERSUASION is too much.</p>

          <p class="fragment">EXPRESSION is not sufficient.</p>

          <p class="fragment">PERSUASION is not necessary.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>The Solution</h3>

          <p class="fragment">A view that goes beyond EXPRESSION but that does not go as far as PERSUASION goes</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Demand</h3>
          <p class="fragment">DEMAND: A and B are having a disagreement iff they are expressing
          conflicting attitudes <strong>and at least one of them is demanding that her
          attitude be shared by the other</strong>.</p>

          <p class="fragment">In my usage, demanding consists in advancing the normative claim
          that the other should, or is required, to agree.</p>

          <p class="fragment"><small>Demand is also a Stevensonian view (a development a of the
          “calling into question element”).</small></p>

          <h3>Disagreement in the state sense</h3>
          <p class="fragment">A question which I have only indirectly addressed: What is
          disagreement in the state sense?</p>

          <p class="fragment">It's unclear what the relation between the state and the activity
          is.</p>
          <p class="fragment">
            <small>There is no convergence in the literature.</small>
          </p>
          
          <p class="fragment">In particular: is there such a thing as a non-doxastic
          disagreement?</p>

          <p class="fragment">Many have answered this question affirmatively, in different
          ways.</p>

          <h3>Experimental Philosophy</h3>
          - Sarkissian et al.: moral objectivism:

          - K&K: semantics:

          - Cova et al.: the nature of asthetic judgments:
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>My Experimental investigation</h3>

          <p class="fragment">Are people inclined to ascribe disagreement in doxastic
          cases (e.g., believing that p and not believing that p) to a
          greater extent than they are in non-doxastic cases (e.g.,
          liking x and not liking x)?</p>

          <p class="fragment">Yes.</p>

          <p class="fragment">People tend to agree in the doxastic case, but give
          wildly different answers in the non-doxastic case (with the
          average ending up in the middle of the scale).</p>

          results?</p>

          <p class="fragment">Do some of them receive particular pressure?</p>

          <p class="fragment">What role can these results play in the semantic debate?</p>

          <p class="fragment">These are some of the questions left for the future...</p>
